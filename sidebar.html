          <p>Our rescue robot is an innovative technology designed specifically to revolutionize borewell rescue operations. Its advanced features include a hand gesture-controlled robotic arm and a telescopic boom mechanism with a balloon attachment, tailored to navigate and operate in confined spaces such as borewells.
  <br> <br>
              The robotic arm of our rescue robot allows for precise and delicate maneuvers, crucial for extracting trapped individuals or animals without causing further harm. The telescopic boom mechanism facilitates accurate positioning and stability, enabling the robot to reach beneath the trapped person or animal and deploy a balloon for buoyancy and safety. <br> <br>
              
              Furthermore, our rescue robot integrates a pulse oximeter in its robotic hand to monitor oxygen levels in real-time, ensuring timely intervention and oxygen supply if necessary. Its two-way communication system enables seamless interaction between rescuers and those trapped underground, enhancing coordination and support during rescue operations. <br> <br>
              
              With its agile design and autonomous navigation capabilities, our rescue robot excels in navigating narrow and challenging environments typical of borewells. This robotic innovation promises to significantly enhance the efficiency and safety of borewell rescue missions, potentially saving lives and minimizing risks associated with traditional rescue methods.</p>
